This is a challenge given by a guy i follow on Twitter.
<br>
The goal is to filter the contact list based on the number 
 typed in the phone keyboard.
 <br>
Example: 
if i press 295, it can match contact name where the three first letter
are `byj`, `azl`, `cxk`, etc.
<br>
I used React with Typescript to make my implementation.
